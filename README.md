# todo-list
A simple todo list web app. Created for Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp. Learning about jQuery element creation, parent elements, CSS transitions, and folder structure. Also, I learned about the importance of using "on" to create event listeners for all potential future elements that might be dynamically created.
